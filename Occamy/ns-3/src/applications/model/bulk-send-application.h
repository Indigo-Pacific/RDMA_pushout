 * as fast as possible up to MaxBytes or until
 * the application is stopped (if MaxBytes is
 * zero). Once the lower layer send buffer is
 * filled, it waits until space is free to
 * send more data, essentially keeping a

 * For example, TCP sockets can be used, but
 * UDP sockets can not be used.
 *
 * If the attribute "EnableSeqTsSizeHeader" is enabled, the application will
 * use some bytes of the payload to store an header with a sequence number,
 * a timestamp, and the size of the packet sent. Support for extracting
 * statistics from this header have been added to \c ns3::PacketSink
 * (enable its "EnableSeqTsSizeHeader" attribute), or users may extract
 * the header via trace sources.
